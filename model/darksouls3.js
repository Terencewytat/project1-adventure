scenes.createScene("Intro","\n Yes indeed. It is called Lothric. Where the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converge. In venturing north, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words. The fire fades. And the lords go without thrones. When the link of fire is threatened, the bell tolls; Unearthing the old lords of cinder from their graves. Aldrich Saint of the Deep; Farronâ€™s Undead Legion the Abyss Watchers; and their reclusive lord of the profaned capitol Yhorm the Giant. Only in truth, the lords will abandon their thrones. And the unkindled will rise. Nameless accursed undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers.",

scenes.createScene("Cemetary_of_Ash","On the top of a hill, on the corner of the cemetary, night has fallen as you wake up from your dilapidated grave. A light fog and cold breeze makes its way through the area, it must've rained recently. Covered in dirt and ash you slowly rise to your feet. The evening bell has tolled and its echoes can be heard from miles away. Around you lay countless other tombstones. Dirt, weeds, and dead trees have run rampant here, you can't make out what these other tombstones say. This place hasn't been cared for in years. \n In front of you is a straight dirt path down the hill. You walk along the path and arrive at the bottom. There you walk alongside the many water puddles and glimpse at the sight of dead trees and fallen structures. As you make way further along, the path begins to widen and you notice a tall cloaked figure slightly hunched over in the crossroad. He's just standing there. His expression is empty. He's also not wearing any shoes. \n You slowly make your way closer. Suddenly, he jerks his head left and right! He just noticed you moving forward and begins screaming as he charges you with what appears to be a shiv in his right hand!",

scenes.createScene("First_Encounter","You defeat the hooded man! His body lay stiff in the mud. You take a part of his soul as he slowly disintigrates into nothing. You are now in the middle of the crossroad. You look left and see what looks like a stone path towards the exit of cemetary. You look right and see a narrow pathway submerged in shallow water leading towards a cavern.",
